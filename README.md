To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
mvn compile exec:java
```

Run `/start` to initiate the system.

```sh
enkan> /start
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```sh
enkan> /reset
```
